# OCAT course repository
- This repository is for the **Optimization Conectp and Application in Transportation**.
- This is a selective course in **Department of Transportation and Logistics Management (TLM)**. 

## Duo Assignment
- This is a Gurobi coding assignment (writen in C++) to implement the **Pick up and Delivery Problem with Time Window (PDPTW)**.
- We implement the original 3-index and the new 2-index formulation
- The corresponding paper is [this one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167637717302651)

## Final Project
- The final project is the implementation of Tabu Search, which is one of meta-heuristics algorithm.
- The file only contains my work, which is the **Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem  (UFLP)**.
- The slides include both UFLP and 2L-CVRP. The latter was conducted by my teammate.

## TSP practice
- practice **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**
- execute wheel selection, crossover (with Partially Mapped Crossover Fill, PMX fill), multiple mutation algorithms, and elite preservation
